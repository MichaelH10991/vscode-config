# vscode-configs

A place that stores and sets up my vscode configuration files.

This repository features a useful utility that puts my configuration files in the right place. This can be run remotely using npx, alternatively the repository can be cloned and run locally.

Remote configuration:

`npx git@github.com:MichaelH10991/vscode-config.git`

Local configuration:

1. `git@github.com:MichaelH10991/vscode-config.git`

2. `cd vscode-config`

3. `npx .`

## TODOs:

- Should publish this to my npm reg at some point.
